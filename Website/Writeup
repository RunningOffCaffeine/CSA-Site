Through this project, I learned some of the basics of Html and JS.
I had some prior experience with HTML during the Spring of 2021, when I participated in the 
UC Berkeley Hackathon, where my team created a super basic website.

I had also previously earned C++ experience as I have created a few mods for some of my favorite
games. However, I was really able to expand my skills during this project.

One of the challenges I faced was just getting everything to align properly, and
to actualle center (sortof) on my page. I have no idea what it loks like
on other computers, but thats a problem for later me. I silved the issue by changing the 
display type to flex, and aligning content to center, and that worked for most, but I 
also simply added padding if I couldn't figure out a better menthod.

This really gave me some respect for people who are a ble to build entirely interactive
web pages for all devices (phones, tablets, etc.)
